# Step One-Shot: Implement, Review, Present

## RULES

- **Language** — Speak in `Chinese`. Write any file output in `Chinese and English`.
- NEVER auto-push.
- All review subagents must run at the same model capability as the current session.
- Run subagents synchronously: launch them together, then wait for all results before continuing.

## INSTRUCTIONS

### Implement

Follow `/Users/weierfu/Projects/IaC-qwen3-tts-speech-central-shim/_bmad/render/bmad-build/iac-qwen3-tts-speech-central-shim-3c29f7ca7b63/2f7bf431e4e22213add6/sync-sprint-status.md` with `target_status` = `in-progress`.

Implement the clarified intent directly.

### Review

Execute these review layers in parallel wherever their execution methods allow. After substituting runtime placeholders, when an instruction launches a reviewer subagent, launch that child with the prompt text; do not load the reviewer instruction file yourself. For any other customized instruction, execute it as written:

#### Blind Hunter (`blind-hunter`)

Launch a context-free subagent with this prompt:

Conduct a review of CONTENT.
Look for what's missing, not only what's wrong.
Find at least ten issues to fix or improve.
Output a Markdown list of findings only — no severity, priority, or ranking.
If the content is empty, stop and say so.
If you have zero findings, re-check and keep thinking; do not stop with an empty list.

CONTENT:
The changed files in the current worktree. Inspect them directly before reviewing.

Do not invoke any skill. Return only the review result.

If a layer's instruction requires subagents and none are available, for each such layer write under `/Users/weierfu/Projects/IaC-qwen3-tts-speech-central-shim/_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts` the exact child prompt from that layer's instruction after placeholder substitution (not a path-only pointer), then HALT. Ask the human to run each in a separate session and paste back the findings.

### Classify

Deduplicate all review findings. Three categories only:

- **patch** — trivially fixable. Auto-fix immediately.
- **defer** — pre-existing issue not caused by this change. Append one new entry to `/Users/weierfu/Projects/IaC-qwen3-tts-speech-central-shim/_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/deferred-work.md` using this format. Do not modify existing entries or look for duplicates.
  ```markdown
  - source_spec: `{spec_file}`
    summary: <one sentence>
    evidence: <why this is real>
  ```
- **reject** — noise. Drop silently.

If a finding is caused by this change but too significant for a trivial patch, HALT and present it to the human for decision before proceeding.

### Generate Spec Trace

Set `title` = a concise title derived from the clarified intent.

Write `{spec_file}` using `/Users/weierfu/Projects/IaC-qwen3-tts-speech-central-shim/_bmad/render/bmad-build/iac-qwen3-tts-speech-central-shim-3c29f7ca7b63/2f7bf431e4e22213add6/spec-template.md`. Fill only these sections — delete all others:

1. **Frontmatter** — set `title: '{title}'`, `type`, `created`, `status: 'done'`. Add `route: 'one-shot'`.
2. **Title and Intent** — `# {title}` heading and `## Intent` with **Problem** and **Approach** lines. Reuse the summary you already generated for the terminal.
3. **Suggested Review Order** — append after Intent. Build using the same convention as `/Users/weierfu/Projects/IaC-qwen3-tts-speech-central-shim/_bmad/render/bmad-build/iac-qwen3-tts-speech-central-shim-3c29f7ca7b63/2f7bf431e4e22213add6/step-05-present.md` § "Generate Suggested Review Order" (spec-file-relative links, concern-based ordering, ultra-concise framing).

Follow `/Users/weierfu/Projects/IaC-qwen3-tts-speech-central-shim/_bmad/render/bmad-build/iac-qwen3-tts-speech-central-shim-3c29f7ca7b63/2f7bf431e4e22213add6/sync-sprint-status.md` with `target_status` = `review`.

### Commit

If version control is available and the tree is dirty, create a local commit with a conventional message derived from the intent. If VCS is unavailable, skip.

### Present

Run `code -r "{project-root}" "{spec_file}"` — the repository root first so VS Code opens in the right context, then the spec file. Always double-quote both paths to handle spaces and special characters. If `code` is unavailable or the command fails, skip gracefully and tell the user the spec file path instead. In the completion summary, note that the spec was sent to VS Code and that it contains a Suggested Review Order, then add this navigation tip: "Ctrl+click (Cmd+click on macOS) the links in the Suggested Review Order to jump to each stop."


Display a summary in conversation output, including:

- The commit hash (if one was created).
- List of files changed with one-line descriptions. Any file paths shown in conversation/terminal output must use CWD-relative format (no leading `/`) with `:line` notation (e.g., `src/path/file.ts:42`) for terminal clickability — this differs from spec-file links which use spec-file-relative paths.
- Review findings breakdown: patches applied, items deferred, items rejected. If all findings were rejected, say so.

Offer to push and/or create a pull request.

HALT and wait for human input.

Workflow complete.

## On Complete

If anything appears below, follow it as the final terminal instruction before exiting; otherwise exit normally.
